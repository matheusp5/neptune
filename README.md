### <b>"Security, queues, simplicity"</b><br>
Neptune is an innovative project for sending email messages. It is capable of storing messages in what we call <b>"queues"</b>, so you can be sure that your emails will be sent. We noticed the security flaws in other mailers for JavaScript, and it was with that in mind that we created a <b>different style of authentication</b>. The project is fully developed with TypeScript, which provides full typing for your project, all for your code to be more cozy

## How to install
